# DAY 1

My first day at GNDEC began with *Kirtan* and *Path* in GURUDWARA SAHIB.After Kirtan we did *Ardaas* to take blessings from SHRI GURU GRANTH SAHIB JI.The college staff provided everyone with breakfast in which we had samosa and gulaab jamun.At sharp 11:00 a.m. everyone entered the auditorium in which the rest of the induction program began.After about 30 minutes the first speaker of the day Ms.Harpreet Kaur welcomed every student on their first day of a long journey in the college,her speech made us feel and realise that we are now already a part of the GNDEC family.


The next speaker was our honoured Principal who enlightened us about this college and explained us about the importance of this platform and to make the best use of this opportunity.Later on he gave us some adice on this prestigious journey.And made us feel like home in this college.The NSET director introduced us to the great 100 year history of this college and how this college have shaped many brilliant minds.And also highlighted the first 36 years that shaped this institute.


The speaker who was going to speak up next was really a magical one as he opened everyone's eyes with his words.And through his many lessons he made it clear that there will be many times that there will be opportuniy right in front of you but do you have the courage to go for it and make it yours ? He made it clear with a real example, in which he extended his hand in which he was holding a note of 500 bucks and asked if anybody from the auditorium wants it.None of the students students stood up except one.After which he explained that this was an opportunity which most of us let it slide through our hands.
